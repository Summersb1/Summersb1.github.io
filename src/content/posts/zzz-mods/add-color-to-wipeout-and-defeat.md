You may notice a warning about the file being 'Executable' due to the presence of a .bin file inside the zip. I want to assure you that it does not contain any viruses. The .bin file was included to address a potential freezing issue.

This mod removes the effect of playable characters and enemies switching from color to monochrome when Wipeout occurs.

It also prevents the screen from changing to monochrome upon Defeat and hides the center elements except for the buttons.

You can customize the mod by changing the values in the “add-color-to-wipeout-and-defeat.ini” file. You can:

- Show or hide center UI elements (except buttons, revival count) on the Defeat screen.

After changing the values, save the ini file and reload it by pressing "F10" in the game.

Installation

Move the add-color-to-wipeout-and-defeat-v6 folder from the zip file’s Mods folder to your game’s Mods folder.

Uninstallation

Remove the add-color-to-wipeout-and-defeat-v6 folder from your Mods folder.

Requirements

Zenless Zone Zero 3dmigoto (ZZMI, XXMI, etc).

If you encounter any issues with the mod or have ideas for improvements, please leave a comment. If possible, I'll fix or add features in a future update.
