You may notice a warning about the file being 'Executable' due to the presence of a .bin file inside the zip. I want to assure you that it does not contain any viruses. The .bin file was included to address a potential freezing issue.

This mod removes outlines for playable characters.

Installation

Place the no-outlines-v4 folder from the Mods folder inside the zip file into your Mods folder.

Move all the .bin and .txt files from the ShaderFixes folder inside the zip file into your ShaderFixes folder.

Uninstallation

Delete the no-outlines-v4 folder from your Mods folder.

Remove all the .bin and .txt files that were added from the zip file in your ShaderFixes folder.

Requirements

Zenless Zone Zero 3dmigoto (ZZMI, XXMI, etc).
