You may notice a warning about the file being "Executable" because there is a .bin file inside the zip. I want to assure you that it does not contain any viruses, and the bin file was included to resolve the freezing issue.

Mod Overview

This mod adds an auxiliary UI for managing character buffs and charge stacks.

Customization

You can customize the mod by editing the Config.ini file, which contains instructions. You can adjust:

- Opacity: Set how transparent the elements are.
- Character Activation: Select which characters the mod applies to.
- Buff UI: Toggle the display of the buff UI.
